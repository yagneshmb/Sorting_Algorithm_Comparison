# Sorting_Algorithm_Comparison
The repository contains comparison between Insertion sort, Selection sort, Bubble sort, and Quick sort for input data size n = 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000.  The input are all non-negative integers. Four separate code files contains four different algorithm implementation.

Run a code file which has common name convention according to the name of algorithm. Running the same would run the sorting algorithm for 12 different scenarios:
  1. Sorted (by non-decreasing order) array with numbers from 1 to 10000
  2. Sorted (by non-decreasing order) array with numbers from 1 to 20000
  3. Sorted (by non-decreasing order) array with numbers from 1 to 50000
  4. Sorted (by non-decreasing order) array with numbers from 1 to 100000
  5. Sorted (by non-increasing order) array with numbers from 10000 to 1
  6. Sorted (by non-increasing order) array with numbers from 20000 to 1
  7. Sorted (by non-increasing order) array with numbers from 50000 to 1
  8. Sorted (by non-increasing order) array with numbers from 100000 to 1
  9. Randomly generated array with range of numbers 1 to 50000 and total numbers 10000
  10. Randomly generated array with range of numbers 1 to 50000 total numbers 20000
  11. Randomly generated array with range of numbers 1 to 50000 total numbers 50000
  12. Randomly generated array with range of numbers 1 to 50000 total numbers 100000

I have also uploaded an excel file which has time recorded in milliseconds and it also has some graphs to visualize time.
