# Sorting_Algorithm_Comparison
The repository contains comparison between Insertion sort, Selection sort, Bubble sort, and Quick sort for input data size n = 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000.  The input are all non-negative integers. Four separate code files contains four different algorithm implementation.

Run a code file which has common name convention according to the name of algorithm. Running the same would run the sorting algorithm for 12 different scenarios:
  1.
